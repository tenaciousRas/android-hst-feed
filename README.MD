This is the source code for the AHST Feed Images widget for Android.  HST Feed is an Android widget that displays the MAST Hubble Space Telescope PR images feed.

This widget can be downloaded from Google Play at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.longevitysoft.android.appwidget.hstfeed.

** Unfortunately, Android insists on corrupting _some_ of the downloaded JPGs.  I expended several options already to no avail.  It seems like some combination of dithering, sample size, and/or RGB mode should get the images to display just like they do in a normal browser!  The next release will attempt to fix that, although it's unclear how that will happen. **

To compile this widget from source code you will need a functional Android development environment.  The only dependency is the Android V4 App Compatibility library, which is included here as a static JAR.

Please note project branches/tags for the latest version of code as reflected in Google Play.
